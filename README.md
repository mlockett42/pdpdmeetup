Other useful info (especially for beginners)
============================================

Indent standard = 4 spaces

`project root` - This is the folder where all files relating to the project and its apps are stored.
Path = `/pdpdmeetup/`

`project app` - This is the core app for the project. Essentially its just the first app that got created and often contains core logic or shared files such as common templates.
Path = `/pdpdmeetup/pdpdmeetup/`

Templates are split into two locations.

1. Project templates which are shared amongst all apps are stored under the `project app`'s templates folder
Path = `/pdpdmeetup/pdpdmeetup/templates`

2. App templates which are app specific (where `app1` is the app name)
Path = `pdpdmeetup/app1/templates`
